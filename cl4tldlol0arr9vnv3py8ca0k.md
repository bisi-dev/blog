## Tutorial: Integrate Flutterwave into your Flutter app

In this article, you are going to learn how to integrate Flutterwave into your Flutter app.

Flutterwave is a fintech company that provides a payment infrastructure for global merchants and payment service providers. A typical use case is a checkout system for an e-commerce solution in your flutter app.

### **PREREQUISITES**
1. [Android Studio / VSCode + Flutter Plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. [Flutterwave Account + API Keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/quickstart)

### STEP 0: CREATE A FLUTTER PROJECT
If you already have a working app, please skip to next step üëá.
If you don't, start by creating a new flutter project by running the following command in your terminal: 

```bash
# terminal

$ flutter create flutter_flutterwave
``` 

This creates a "hello world" flutter app called "flutter_flutterwave". Open this folder in an editor of your choice.


### STEP 1: ADD YOUR API KEYS TO YOUR PROJECT
It is very unsafe to expose your API keys in a project. It is OK to expose a public key from a cryptographic standpoint, but from a security standpoint, always take great care in protecting all keys to avoid theft and misuse. Therefore, create a .env file in your project's root folder and add your flutterwave public key to it. 

```env
# .\.env

PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR-FLUTTERWAVE-PUBLIC-KEY
``` 

Include the .env file in your pubspec.yaml to ensure that Flutter recognizes it. You can do so by adding it in the assets list like this:

```yaml
# .\pubspec.yaml

assets:
  - .env
``` 

### STEP 2: INSTALL THE NECESSARY PACKAGES
Add the [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) and [Flutterwave](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterwave_standard) pub package to your pubspec.yaml file. You can do so by including it in the dependencies block like this:

```yaml
# .\pubspec.yaml

dependencies:
  flutter_dotenv: ^5.0.2
  flutterwave_standard: 1.0.2
``` 

Then run the `flutter pub get` command in your project's folder. This would install the flutter_dotenv and Flutterwave SDK package in your project.


### STEP 3: CREATE YOUR CHECKOUT PAGE AND CARD

Create a simple checkout page with a "Pay with flutterwave" card. This will act as an interface for a user checkout action. A basic action card in flutter looks like this:

```dart
# .\lib\screens\checkout.dart

Widget CheckOutCard() {
    return InkWell(
      onTap: () {},
      child: Card(),
    );
  }
```

You can find the source code for the entire checkout page UI at this particular step [üëâ here](https://github.com/bisi-dev/flutter_flutterwave/blob/88b7ac00f15195ce20d236630de0dcd930632569/lib/screens/checkout.dart).

### STEP 4: IMPORT THE NECESSARY PACKAGES
Connect the flutter_dotenv and Flutterwave packages to your project. You can use them by adding these lines to the top of your checkout page:

```dart
# .\lib\screens\checkout.dart

import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';
import 'package:flutterwave_standard/flutterwave.dart';
```

### STEP 5: LOAD YOUR API KEYS
Load the contents of your .env file with this code snippet.
```dart
# .\lib\screens\checkout.dart

void _loadDotEnv () async{
    await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");
  }

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _loadDotEnv();
}
```
### DEEP DIVE
This snippet creates a private async function called `_loadDotEnv()`. The function makes use of the flutter_dotenv package to load the environment variables in your .env file. By calling the _loadDotEnv function in the `init state` (start) of your checkout page, you can now access your API keys at **"dotenv.env['PUBLIC_KEY']"**.

### STEP 6: CREATE FLUTTERWAVE PAYMENT FUNCTION
Create a Flutterwave payment function in your checkout page.
```dart
# .\lib\screens\checkout.dart

final String amount = "1000";
final String txRef = "unique_transaction_ref_${Random().nextInt(100000)}";

void _makePayment() async {
    final style = FlutterwaveStyle(
        appBarText: "Pay with Flutterwave",
        buttonColor: Colors.orangeAccent,
        appBarIcon: Icon(Icons.payment_rounded, color: Colors.black),
        buttonTextStyle: TextStyle(
          color: Colors.black,
          fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          fontSize: 18,
        ),
        appBarColor: Colors.orange,
        dialogCancelTextStyle: TextStyle(
          color: Colors.redAccent,
          fontSize: 18,
        ),
        dialogContinueTextStyle: TextStyle(
          color: Colors.blue,
          fontSize: 18,
        )
    );

    final Customer customer = Customer(
        name: "FLW Customer",
        phoneNumber: "12345678910",
        email: "flwcustomer@qa.team");

    final Flutterwave flutterwave = Flutterwave(
        context: context,
        style: style,
        publicKey: dotenv.env['PUBLIC_KEY']!,
        currency: "NGN",
        txRef: txRef,
        amount: amount,
        customer: customer,
        paymentOptions: "ussd, card, barter, payattitude",
        customization: Customization(title: "Test Payment"),
        isTestMode: true);

    final ChargeResponse response = await flutterwave.charge();
    if (response != null) {
      print(response.toJson())
      if (response.success! && response.txRef == txRef) {
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(snackBarSuccess);
      } else {
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(snackBarFailure);
      }
    } else {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(snackBarFailure);
    }
  }
```
We have reached the crux of this article, please do not be overwhelmed üôèüôèüôè. We are almost there!!!
### VERY DEEP DIVE
This snippet creates a private async function called `_makePayment()`.

-  With the `style` variable, we  utilise the FlutterwaveStyle class to customise the look of our makePayment instance. It is not compulsory to include a style but to ensure uniformity of your app, please customise this to your taste.
-  With the `customer` variable, we use the Customer class to define the customer we intend to charge. You should look to pass in these values dynamically in a public application.
- With the `flutterwave` variable, we define a Flutterwave constructor that takes compulsory properties of `context` (calling context), `publicKey`, `txRef`(unique transaction reference), `amount` (amount to be charged), `customer`,  `currency` (currency to debit in), `paymentOptions`(different payment options offered by Flutterwave), `customization`(business logo, description and title on the modal) and `isTestMode` (Flutterwave account mode).

P.S: The txRef **MUST** be unique. The flutterwave instance will not load the flutterwave payment modal if you pass a reference that has already been paid with. In this tutorial we make use of the `dart:math` library to generate a random number. More stringent options can be exercised. You should also set `isTestMode` to false if you're using a live flutterwave account.

- The `response` variable returns a future of ChargeResponse after calling the flutterwave object with a `.charge()` method. A successful response looks like this:
```json
{status: success, success: true, transactionId: 3507966, txRef: unique_transaction_ref_964300}
```
Then, we use this response to determine if a transaction is successful.
If `response.success` is true and `response.txRef` tallies with ours, it is, and we can provide value to the customer [e.g. navigate to a new page, call an endpoint, write to a database, etc. ]. This tutorial just displays a Snackbar.

### STEP 7: ADD THE FUNCTION IN THE ONTAP CALLBACK OF YOUR CHECKOUT CARD

```dart
# .\lib\screens\checkout.dart

Widget CheckOutCard() {
    return InkWell(
      onTap: () {
        _makePayment();
      },
      child: Card(),
    );
  }
```
This will ensure the payment function is called once your action card is clicked.

### MORE
I have added a list of flutterwave test cards you can use to test your payment app. These cards will only work if you are using a flutterwave test account i.e `isTestMode: true`. Find them [üëâhere](https://github.com/bisi-dev/flutter_flutterwave/blob/main/cards.txt).
<br>I have also included each step as a commit in this GitHub [üëârepo](https://github.com/bisi-dev/flutter_flutterwave/commits/main).
